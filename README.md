## 📁 Featured Project
### 🔹 [aws-devops-learning](https://github.com/arunmahato1421/aws-devops-learning)
This repository is a lab where I practice end-to-end DevOps workflows:
- Building Docker images and pushing to Docker Hub  
- Writing GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD  
- Experimenting with AWS services and Terraform scripts  
- Deploying containers and automating infrastructure  

**Workflow in brief:**  
1. Code pushed to `main` branch  
2. GitHub Action triggers → builds Docker image  
3. Authenticates and pushes image to Docker Hub (`arunmahato1421/aws-devops-learning:latest`)  
4. (Optional) Scripted deployment to a test environment

## 🌱 What I’m Learning Now
- Kubernetes orchestration and container scheduling  
- Advanced Terraform patterns on AWS  
- Monitoring & observability in DevOps (Prometheus, Grafana)  
- Python scripting for automation in DevOps pipelines

## 🎯 Career Goal
I aim to transition into a full-fledged **DevOps Engineer / Cloud Infrastructure Engineer** role — combining my 11+ years Networking background with automation, cloud architecture, and CI/CD expertise.
